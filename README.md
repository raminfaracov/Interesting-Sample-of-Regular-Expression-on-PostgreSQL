# Let's look at examples of "Regular Expression" on an interesting issue.

How we can sort numbers with Letters. 
For example:
We have a these 

EL-300-A
EL-580
J-38125
Nick
Nick1.0
javier
test
test1
test32
test2121AgainOn4/28
test12345
test123467 againOn4/28
test123467
test123467 again

string data on the table. We needing sort this data using these rules: 
1) sort string letters firstly
2) if has numbers inside the string then sorting numbers as a number type principies.
